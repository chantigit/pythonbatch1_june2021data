Python modules & packages:
==========================
1.module 	: A module is python file which consist of multiple data + functions + classes

2.package   : A package is a directory which consist of multiple modules & sub packages

Adv:
====
	->Maintaintability of code
	->Code reusability
	
Q1.How to use Python modules & packages ?

Ans:
	1.By using normal import
	
		->syntax:
				import modulename
		->In this type of import, we can access all module members & each time we must declare modulename along
			with the member
		->Ex:
		import math
		print(math.pi)
		print(math.e)
		print(math.sin(90))
		print(math.tan(45))
        print(math.pow(2,10))
        print(math.sqrt(144))
        print(math.ceil(5.6))
        print(math.floor(5.6))
		
	2.By from import
		->syntax:
				from modulename import members
				
		->In this type of import, we can access specific module members & here you need not to declare modulename along
			with the member
		->Ex:

		from math import sin,pi
		print(sin(90))
		print(pi)
		
		from chanti import a,b,sayhi
		print(a,b)
		sayhi()

Aliaing the modules:
===================
	import math as m
	import chanti as c

Exception handling in Python:
=============================
1.Error
		It  is generated at compile time due to improper syntax
		Errors cannot be handled
2.Exception
		It  is generated at run time due to improper logic
Ex:
	ZeroDivisionError		: division by zero
	IndexError				: string index out of range
	IndexError				: list index out of range
	TypeError				: 'set' object is not subscriptable
	ValueError				: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'APPLE'

	Exceptions can be handled by using following keywords
	
	1.try
	2.except
	3.finally
	
	4.else
	5.raise

syntax of try,except,finally:
=============================
try:
	#prepare block of statements which monitoring the exceptions
	#Scenario1:No exceptions  	(try -> finally)
	#Scenario2:Exceptions exist (try -> first except)
	
except ExceptionClass1Name:
	#prepare block of statements which handle the exception1
	#After handling control goes to finally
except ExceptionClass2Name:
	#prepare block of statements which handle the exception2
	#After handling control goes to finally
except ExceptionClass3Name:
	#prepare block of statements which handle the exception3
	#After handling control goes to finally

finally:
	#prepare block of statements which executed after try
	#prepare block of statements which executed after except
