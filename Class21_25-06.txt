1.NON-FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING DISADVANTAGES
2.FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ADVANTAGES
3.Called Function:
	Preparation of function
4.Calling Function:
	Usage of function
5.Argument	:
	Values which are present in calling function is called as argument
6.Parameter	:
	Vaiables which are present in called function header is called as parameter
7.Function preparation ways
8.Variable Types
	1.Local  Variables
	2.Global Variables
9.Global keyword
10.Aliasing the function
11.Keyword as argument
12.Default parameters
13.Pass keyword
14.Arbitary argument / Variable length arguments
15.Lambda function  / Anonymous function
16.main() function
17.Function execution approach(top-to-bottom)
18.Call by Value & Call by Reference
19.Nested Functions & Closure property
20.Recursion
21.Pass function as argumrnt to another function
22.A function can used as return statement to another function
23.Decorators  (19,21,22)
24.Generators
--------------------------------------------------------------
Decorators:
-----------
It is a special type of function used to extra functionality to the existing function without modifying it.

1.Inner function
2.function pass as argument to another function
3.function as return type to the another function

Generators:
-----------
It is a special type of function used to generate numbers using yield keyword

String:
=======
Def:
	Collection/Group/Sequence of characters enclosed with in either double quotes or single quotes.
	
Reprepsenation:
	1.Single line strings	:	double quotes or single quotes
	2.Multi line strings	:   triple double quotes or triple single quotes
	
Note:
	string always creates immutable(content cannot be modified until we assign the result) object
