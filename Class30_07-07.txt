OOPS with Python:
=================
OOPS = Object Oriented Programming Structure

Cpp 	follows Object Oriented Programming Structure
Java 	follows	Object Oriented Programming Structure
C#.net 	follows	Object Oriented Programming Structure
Python 	follows	Object Oriented Programming Structure


Object Oriented Programming Principles are (CO-APIE)
	Class
	Object
	Abstraction
	Polymorphism
	Inheritance
	Encapsulation
	
Object Oriented Programming features APIE
Object Oriented Programming features are implemented by CO

Q1.	Object Oriented Programming Language Vs Object Based Programming Language
	
	-> Supports all OOPS principles				-> Cannot supports P & I principles
	-> Ex: Cpp,Java,Python,C#.net,..			Ex: JavaScript,Vb.net ,...
	-> Provides readymade classes not objects	-> Provides readymade classes & objects

Q2. What are Advantages OOPS ?

	Simplicity of code is achived by 		Class & 	Object
	Confidentiality of code is achived by 	Abstraction
	Readability of code is achived by 		Polymorphism
	Reusability of code is achived by 		Inheritance
	Modularity  of code is achived by 		Encapsulation


Snytax for Class :

class	ClassName:
	#Data
	#Methods

Snytax for Object :

	objectName=ClassName(object values)
